hello-world-app
===============

This application takes in your name, and when you push the button, it displays "Hello, yourname"

The first responder status is a way of describing what is the active component of the app.  The

keyboard is displayed when a text field is the first responder.  It can be dismissed if something 

else takes over as first responder.  As we coded it, we dismiss the textfield as the first responder,

which causes the keyboard to go away
